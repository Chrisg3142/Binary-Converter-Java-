This program takes in binary of any length and converts it into decimal form.
The program will not accept anything but 0's and 1's
The program will stop once all numbers have been read and calculated to give you the number in decimal.
I want to add a system where you can convert any type such as binary to decimal, decimal to binary, and binary to hexadeciml,
with my currrent knowledge it may take some time but I have some ideas.
